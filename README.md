# Bikesharing

## Overview
The purpose of the analysis on this repository is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To do so, bike trip analysis is performed on Citibike data from NYC to figure out how the business works in New York. From that analysis, a proposal is created on how it might work in Des Moines. The following results describe the analysis from NYC and how it would apply in Des Moines.


## Results

This map visualization shows where the starting locations are for bikeshare rides and are colored and sized by the count at each station. One observation was that there may have been a higher count of riders at starting locations that had higher amounts of tourism at them. This is one of the original visualizations created early on in the analysis and a key indicator at where the first locations should be positioned in Des Moines. 

### How long do they ride?

New York City does not have a bikeshare business where its riders are on their bikes for a long time. As seen in this graph, the majority of bikes are only used for less than an hour per ride. This business might have more to do with easy commuting around the city rather than taking long scenic joyrides. This presents two different opportunities to the investors on where they can place their bikeshare stations. One may serve the workfoce for commuting around the city during the day and and the other locations could be for leisure and joyriding around scenic routes or any special landmarks that would be worth a nice long ride to. 

### Who are the main riders?

</p>

This graph shows that there are a lot more males riding bikes around NYC than females. Female riders are in blue, male riders are in orange, and riders whos genders were unknown are in red. As an outsider that is not familiar with the area, one might wonder if there are more males than females in NYC and that is where there is such a big difference. If not, investors might consider how to be more inclusive of females to increase their numbers and improve the business opportunity when applied to Des Moines.

### What are the peak hours?

The heatmap above shows the count of riders by the time of day and the day of the week. The darker colors represent higher counts as seen on the legend, and lighter yellow colors represent less traffic of riders. As mentioned above, it appears the bikeshare business in NYC likely caters to the working community for their source of transportation to and from work. Although areas might have higher traffice with tourism in those areas, the majority of traffic shown on the bikes is during the commuting hours of the day during the week. Weekends tend to be more populated on bikes during the days as expected when peopl are going out to have some fun!

### Are peak hours the same for males and females?
